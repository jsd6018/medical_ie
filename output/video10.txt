so
the first case we have is richard who's
uh here today
and so he's 55 years old and he was
diagnosed no
sorry 65 sorry i must have died
i must have typed it wrong so he's had
diabetes for about 10 years now and he's
had a few complications including some
kidney disease which is why he was here
in this office and
he saw a colleague of mine dr ting and
so he was referred into the intensive
dietary management program
and we started him in june of 2013
and we started him with a fasting
regimen
as opposed to the amount of insulin that
he had so this is richard
and his wife i can't see that very well
and this is what's happened to his
weight so his weight starting
just above 250 has been steadily coming
down
and it's down to 210 his waist size has
continued to come down
and his hemoglobin a1c which is the
measure of his sugars has
stayed relatively stable below seven
percent
and this is him now so if you look at
what has happened to his
insulin dose so he started off with
55 units of insulin and within you know
six weeks he was off of all his insulin
in other words he his sugars are doing
fine
and he's off of all his medications
completely and his
you know his his levels of a1c are no
longer at a level where you could
make this case that he is diabetic in
other words
you could say that his diabetes has been
cured
by using these kind of simple uh
understanding of diabetes you can see
that this is actually the rational but
also the natural way
to cure diabetes we're not talking about
piling on more drugs for you i mean you
go to some of these
places they'll tell you to take these
experimental drugs and they want to sign
you for drug trials no
what we're doing has been done for
thousands of years
and is in fact exactly the way they used
to treat diabetes
but they understood that it was a
dietary disease it has to be treated
with dietary measures
megan and i was terrified
i thought my god you know shirt of
diabetes no way
so i listened and i give it a try and at
first
it was scary you know just you know
you're not eating
i did cheat once in a while
but as time went on i got used to it
and it was wonderful now but
there's a few corrections i'm down to
200 pounds now
this morning wow my waist size is from
oh almost 50 inches down to 40 inches
you know thanks to everybody here and
now it's a breeze you know it is so easy
i feel so healthy
and how was the how was the actual
fasting did you find that very difficult
were you hungry
were you uh grouchy tired like those are
the main concerns people i tell people
and they're like
oh i can't do that that's the first
reaction i think everybody gets that
reaction i can't do that
i'm going to be tired all the time i'm
going to be hungry all the time
how did you feel oh excellent
i've got so much more energy
i feel great i my
it's hard to put into words but i feel
very healthy
i feel fantastic you know i was not
tired
and you know a lot of people are
concerned about
not even food are you going to be tired
are you going to be sick
and whatnot and you know once i adjusted
after about
four or five weeks
i feel great you know like you sleep
better at night
you're you're happier
that can tell you about that
i think that's the experience and that's
what what's actually very interesting
is that many many people actually come
back and they say the exact same thing
let's say i feel great when i'm fasting
and it there's actually a very good
reason for that
and when you're fasting the body is
actually
increasing the amount of adrenaline
because so you're actually feeling more
energized than when you didn't fast
and i i think that that's one of the
things that people didn't really
understand the other thing that about
the hunger
is that the body actually switches to
burning some of the fat
and when it starts to burn some of the
fat you're actually feeding your own
body
through your own fat and therefore
you're not hungry all the time
as you start to eat you'll actually
start to get more hungry so it's
actually
easier i think too fast than to follow
these very low calorie diets like you
know
500 calories a day or something if you
follow those very low calorie diets
once you start eating you've switched
off from burning fat
because you're eating so the body is not
burning fat and then it says okay
since i'm not burning fat and i'm not
eating very much i'm really hungry
so then you actually get very hungry
whereas if you don't eat anything at all
it's actually much easier it's kind of
like once you start doing something it's
easy to continue and it's the same thing
when you're not
eating it's actually very easy for your
body to continue
because it just keeps burning that fat
and it's feeding itself through the fat
thanks very much richard and maybe i can
speak to your wife as well overall
experience has been
fantastic i mean it's only been a few
months now and
they've given me my life back to me you
know i just want to say a
warm thank you to everybody here
especially megan
doctor thank you dr king they've been
great
thank you thanks richard
all right thanks very much
so i'm gonna i'm gonna speak to his wife
jeanette who actually wasn't
um a patient but she came with him come
on have a seat here
and why don't you tell us what happened
uh what your story is
well i came in with my husband richard
because he wanted me to be here to find
out what this was all about and again
i'm just kind of skeptical
but then i thought well you know i'm a
little bit
heavy myself maybe i should try this
program just for weight loss
and i think i've lost about 40 pounds in
since june so that's great
i the only drawback is i now
can shop in my favorite store that
doesn't carry
driving my husband crazy because they
keep coming back with new clothes
but no it's great and i can i can
honestly say that the fasting
is not difficult you just
you know and i i'm because i'm on
certain meds i have to eat a breakfast
every morning
but i i ate less of a breakfast
and then i do the fast for the rest of
the day but it is not
hard you feel a lot better and you're a
lot happier
and megan also mentioned your also had
improved your mobility as well is that
uh um yeah today i've got a bit of an
infection in my foot
i'm stumbling a bit but yeah i um
people are amazed um that i can walk so
fast either when you slow down
yeah so it has help but because you're
not carrying
extra weight so i cannot keep up with
her now
she went from wheelchair bed wheelchair
to walker the king
now you can't keep up with this girl now
that she's
reduced are you with me way back there
richard you know
and i've also uh been taking off one of
my blood pressure pills
and no i am
