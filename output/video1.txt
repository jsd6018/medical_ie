wellness
as you know this has been an
unprecedented year and we've really
continued to try to find ways to help
people connect with their community

and find ways to find peace and mind
body and spirit
through these very challenging times for
today's session of zoom
into wellness we're coming back to
diabetes success stories
and i'm happy to have with me ally
maddie ally maddie i've known for some
time
and she's got quite the story so ally
thank you so much for joining us today
thanks for having me jay you bet um
so tell me a little bit about your
diabetes story like when were you
diagnosed and how you were diagnosed
um okay so i was diagnosed with diabetes
in 2017
um i think it was around may 2017. i was
pre-diabetic
for about a year before that um
i was pretty young at the time and i
didn't quite understand
what pre-diabetic meant um
and what being diabetic would mean for
the rest of my life so
i didn't take it very seriously um when
i got the um
the word that i was pre-diabetic so
i oh gosh you're gonna make me do math
right now
um i was 18 i think
um so freshly into college uh living my
life
doing my thing um not not putting a lot
of emphasis
on my health in general um and then i
went to
a family doctor she's a good family
friend of ours
and we ran some blood work my a1c came
back at about 8.2
i think um so we decided i'm diabetic at
that point obviously
and um i remember her saying things like
you know this is this is gonna be your
forever you're always diabetic you're
always gonna take these medications
um these are things that are going to
follow you the rest of your life
um and so we made a plan i started
taking medications
um i started tracking a lot um
trying to figure out what worked best
for me so um yeah it all started back in
2017 i think
wow and again so being 18 and hearing
all those things that's
that had to be overwhelming yes
absolutely
and it sounds like you actually kind of
your first step was uh
some kind of response in terms of like
tracking how did you receive that and
you know kind of internalize that to say
how am i going to do something about
this yeah um
so still i wasn't taking it too
seriously i didn't quite understand
um what i needed to do as a diabetic
you know in general health i was like
okay i need to eat better and i need to
exercise
got it um so i started tracking when i
was eating i
took my blood sugars i think three times
a day i took it first thing in the
morning
um i wrote down what i ate for breakfast
i ate lunch
i would take my sugar about two hours
after lunch and two hours after dinner
to kind of find
trends in in that um for a while i was
extra crazy and i ate the same thing
every day
to see if my sugars were the same every
day and then i would just change one
thing
um to see how that one thing would
affect me
uh so i took it really seriously um
there there for a while
um you know it was about a year in i got
my second blood sugar check um
and it was down to seven wow
two seven three so i made i made some
good strides there
um i got kind of lazy again
it was probably still the same about a
year later um
but just recently i started taking it a
lot more seriously um
start of 2020 actually which is a crazy
time to
make a big life change but it ended up
working out really well for me so
um yeah i think that's
and internally it was hard at first but
um once i started figuring out what
worked for me
and thinking about it a little more
deeply um
i started doing a lot more research
about it as well
i talked to you a lot when i would come
see you and casey
um and i just think
knowledge in general um really helped me
so
yeah and you said some things that
really rung true to me you did all this
engagement up front
and really scientifically you actually
did that kind of isolation diet to see
exactly what things were affecting your
glucose which is amazing
um but you kind of it sounds like you
fell off the wagon after
a year or so and that's pretty common in
diabetes
um and i don't know if you remember what
you were feeling at the time or
you know it could be just that it's
really hard but i you know i don't know
if you
remember that yeah i had i had a lot of
big life changes happening
um i was in college and i was
not doing as well as i would have liked
to be doing
um you know i was moving around a little
bit
trying to navigate um some things in my
personal life
so that definitely did not help me and
um i don't know i just felt sad
all the time i was always sad and i
didn't know why
so that was a big big part of why i just
kind of was like
gave up there for a little bit but um
you know like normal
for a lot of people that's that's a very
common experience
um and then of all times 2020
the pandemic you found new spirits so
what happened
yeah so um i moved to marietta in
2019 i am working at a bank here
and one of my friends um said hey do you
want to go to a pound class
i was like i have no idea what that is
um i thought it was like a drumming
class you know
we're gonna learn to drum and i said
sure why not
um after work that day we walked into a
gym
uh and i was i had not exercised in
like five or six years at that point and
i was not ready i didn't have tennis
shoes i didn't have
the proper clothing um and pound is
a workout where you use uh weighted
drumsticks and you drum to a beat
right um and i instantly fell in love i
loved group exercise i loved
the um vibrance of it all the gym i go
to is rockstar wellness and marietta
and the owners rachel and scott are just
so encouraging
and great and everyone there just
wants you to succeed um so i instantly
fell in love i
kept going back and i kept going back
and i kept going back
they started a nutrition program so
rachel is a nutritionist
um or registered nutrition um
and she started a nutrition program so
we started doing some
deeper dives into what we were eating
they did a local csa box
her family owns a farm so we got weekly
vegetables
delivered to us which was very helpful
um i don't think i've ever eaten so many
vegetables in my whole life
um and i just fell in love with the way
i was feeling
um i felt happy leaving exercise which
was
insane who who knew you could be happy
when you were exercising
right um and then i i looked at
food finally as fuel for my body more
than anything
um and i stopped using food as a way to
celebrate
victories which was huge um
that that was how my family that's how
we were growing up right something
exciting would happen let's go out to
dinner let's have friends over for
a party and have lots of food and cool
things
so once i stopped using food as a way to
celebrate or
a way to deal with any type of feeling
things really changed for me um since
i've become
a group x instructor i now teach pound
i got my group x certification through
ace
i can teach amp resistance and i'm
currently getting an aerobics
certification and a foam rolling
certification so
a lot has changed there so if i heard
correctly
a year ago you had done zero exercise
and exercise for the first time
and a year later you're a certified
instructor in multiple different classes
in like five different formats yes um so
yeah my first like three months or so of
exercising i just did like one class a
week or so
um and then kovit hit so that was
interesting the gym
rockstar was really great about
transitioning to all online
so since we were working from home um i
was able to
i was doing like three classes a night
probably um
at least on top of the nutrition
coaching
um i've also started doing personal
training there which is
super fun um yeah so
kovit helped me actually i was able to
to really slow my life down and think
about things that were more important
and dive a little deeper into the
exercise side of things
and it really really pushed me to get
these certifications and just
really change the way i think about
things so
you use this pandemic as an opportunity
to reset
and it sounds like you made your
orientation the food different sounds
like you really
engaged in physical activity how did
that affect your glucose how did that
affect your meds
um you know because again that's it's
healthy for all parts of your body
but i know that your original challenge
was diabetes so how did that affect
diabetes
um significantly my sugars
started going down significantly
obviously before
when i would wake up in the morning my
sugars would be you know in the 140s
150s
which is not as good as
i'd want them to be obviously um so my
sugar started going down
which was awesome um in may of 2020
um so a little bit into my exercise i
got my
a1c checked again and it was at a 5.2
wow it was insane um something that i
i was not expecting that at all um and i
just got it checked again this week and
i'm down to
a five which is amazing
they're amazing yeah we're gonna see 0.6
at its highest
eight point three eight point two
something like that
okay um and i'm down to five now which
is awesome
my doctor and i are going to start
taking me off of my medication
so i won't be medicine dependent which
is amazing um so i'm really looking
forward to that that'll be really fun
that's just incredible um so have there
been any other changes
um other than like like did your blood
pressure change did your weight change
did anything else change as a response
to all these things yeah so my weight
definitely has changed um
i i've lost 80 pounds i lost 80 pounds
in my first year
um continuing i still have a long way to
go
but 80 pounds feels pretty incredible um
i think that the best change that i've
seen though is just my mood
i just feel like such a different person
i feel happier
um even on like the rainy days um
i can see the sun and it just feels good
to be
alive and spreading kindness and
excitement about wellness in general um
i feel like i'm
able to help people that were in a
situation that i was in which
is so rewarding it's so cool
that is and and that sadness is not
pervasive so much anymore
no not at all no no no
so you know i think that your experience
as a young person
feeling invincible like i'll worry about
this later those things
um you're different in that you've acted
upon it and you've really taken
charge if you could give a message to
other young people
what what message would you give and i
realized that every person is different
right so there's not
one way to help so but what would you
share what would you want to share to
your your peers
um i think the most important thing is
just starting
um i think that's the scary part right
so you get
told this big news um or something
you need to change right people say you
need to do better you need to change
something needs to happen um and
as a young person that's new even if
you're not young and you just don't
understand what's
going on it can be scary to jump in and
just doing anything is better than doing
nothing and just sitting there in your
fear
right so um my first step was
you know i'm not changing my diet at all
i'm just gonna write it down
just writing it down um whatever i eat
gets written down on a piece of paper
so um and then it was a little scary to
like step back and be like wow
look at what i'm eating this is not good
um
i think journaling is really important
though of we're tracking in any way
tracking is important um so
just start whatever it is if you want to
start with your diet if you want to
start with exercise
um you just gotta get up and do it it's
not gonna feel good the first time you
do it but
um one day you're gonna look back and
say wow how
how did i live life without doing these
things
so well i think you are just absolutely
amazing
and i am just so uh happy to hear your
success story of course i've seen you in
your success story
