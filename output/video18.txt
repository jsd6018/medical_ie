north indians are generally known to
consider a healthy appetite
to be a desirable trait for all healthy
boys
unfortunately the side effects are
anything but healthy
as pulkit honda can attest brought upon
a typical punjabi diet pulkit for most
of his childhood years
was a fairly chubby lad the results of
childhood excesses
all too often only show up much later in
life
as it did for pulkit too but pulkit
fought back
and broke the vicious spiral of diabetes
and other complications
to emerge healthy and well capping his
diabetes reversal
by successfully passing the glucose
tolerance test
this year
[Music]
in 2012 when i was around 37 year old
i suffered a massive weight loss
during the same time i also noticed that
my water intake
you know has increased and
simultaneously
i started having sort of skin allergy
boils on my legs and i thought
it's a normal allergy and you know i can
go ahead and use some
cream on that other problems i had were
of high
cholesterol levels hypertension
sensory neuropathy back pain my knees
used to pain all
the time i had issue with my
hair my hair were falling like anything
also i was not getting proper sleep
well my uncle had severe diabetes and
you know we lost him due to kidney
failure
and his demise impacted all of us
currently i'm working as a president
with a
private sector bank the never-ending
targets to be met
and i was trying to be a perfect juggler
by balancing my professional
and personal life i also have other
interests
like theater writing scripts directing
plays
making documentaries and i also work for
few ngos
by the way i'm also a chef
one day when i was busy with my stuff i
experienced
fainting sensation i
went to the doctor and he suggested some
tests to be done
i was not aware what hba1c
is my doctor was shocked to find out my
fasting sugar level which was 515
and my hb a1c level was 11.5
i went home did some googling i tried
finding out
more details about diabetes i cried
i felt shut out and
i felt really confused
[Music]
i had fear about i will
probably have a heart attack or a kidney
failure or gangrene
or eyesight loss so all sort of
disturbing thoughts
came to my mind my doctor started me
with
metamorphin plus my cholesterol levels
were very high so i was also put on
uh cholesterol medicine and i was
already
on bp medication since 2010.
the feeling i had was not only me who is
a diabetic i think my
family has also become a diabetic family
because they had to adjust
with my food restrictions also
my mood swings
plus i started also experiencing
shortness of breath
in 2018 my weight reached
at an all-time high of 128 or 130
and my doctor advised me to immediately
lose weight and they put me on some
injections as well
in 2019 i saw an advertisement of
freedom from diabetes and dr tripati
i contacted him and he said will kit why
don't you go through
some of the videos freedom from diabetes
and see it for yourself how things work
later when i was in mumbai uh i attended
uh an open session by dr pramatra party
it was actually an eye opener for me i
immediately went ahead
and enrolled for this one year program
and i got inducted in the intensive
reversal program batch number 54. after
attending the session i got convinced
that diabetes can be reversed within 10
days of joining the course
meri diabetes
and within about one month my
cholesterol tablets
were stopped by the doctors dr promote
started me to try out with fasting i
started with
24 hours of fasting then went on to 36
hours
48 hours 72 hours then
i did fasting for 23 days that was just
unbelievable for me to fast for 23 days
and i had massive weight loss and other
health benefits
with the fasting process when i had
achieved
substantial weight loss dr malhat told
me
to go for muscle training
i do gyming
six hours in a week
i do yoga for about five hours in a week
i do 150 kilometers of cycling in a week
and also i'm able to do the most
difficult
yoga asanas like shifts arsenal
in last one year i've lost 23 kgs
from 115 kgs
to 92 kgs today but as
dr malar says less of statistics
and more of emotions we discussed that
how much stamina we have gained how much
mental and physical
strength we have gained and it's not
only about
losing weight it's all about how much we
are disciplined
and determined to get rid of this fatal
disease
i also do water fasting once in every 10
to 12 days now
my t-shirt size from xxxl
has come down to a large size my waist
size
from 47 inches to 39 inches i had a lot
of blemishes on my foreheads
they are also gone now and i'm
experiencing
less hair fall now in fact i started
having
hair growth this year i have
successfully passed the glucose
tolerance test
and i was also awarded with a gtt medal
at the grand finale of the fft event
my family has noticed a radical change
in my attitude
towards life for better it is not only
the change in my physical appearance
diabetic free free from medication for
very high cholesterol levels
but i've also become more calm and
composed
now for me it's almost a rebirth
as i've created a better version of
myself
and i call myself as pulkit 2.0
[Music]
ffd has not only changed my life it has
also
changed my family's life getting
inspired by me

6 kgs in 2 months

wonderful team may his good work spread
to more and more people
